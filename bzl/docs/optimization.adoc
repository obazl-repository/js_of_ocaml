== optimizing executables: exec-libs

With Obazl we can optimize Dune's `executables` stanzas. In such
stanzas multiple executables may depend on the same "exec-lib". We can
build that lib just once and share it among all the executables whose
"main" module depends on it.

Concepts: exec modules are those linked directly into the executable.
The "name" (or "names") field of a dune executable(s) marks the "main
exec module. The other modules, upon which the exec depends, form the
"exec lib".
